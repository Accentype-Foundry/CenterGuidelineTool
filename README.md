# Center Guideline Tool

A Glyphs.app General Plugin that creates a centered guideline between selected nodes or existing guides in a glyph.

---

## What it does

This plugin helps you quickly create guidelines:

- Centered between **one node and one existing guide**  
- Centered between **two existing guides**  
- Centered based on **selected nodes**, with options for horizontal, vertical, or diagonal orientation

It automatically integrates into Glyphs' **Edit menu**, so once Glyphs starts, the plugin is ready to use.
